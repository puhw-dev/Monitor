---- INSTRUCTION TO COMPILE AND RUN Monitor on fatcat ----

The files tree should looks like:

./ # <- project home directory
 | monitor/
 |        | RestServer.java
 |        | Monitor.java
 |        | DataBase.java
 | sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar
 | makefile
 | monitor.db # <- if not provide, will be generate but only with USERS data read form propreties file
 | json-simple-1.1.1.jar
 | configure.properties
 -------------------------------------
 And for UDP part of monitor we've got also
 | config/
 |           | client_config.json
 |           | server_config.json
 | logs/
 | src/
          | client.py
          | crypt.py
          | custom_exc.py
          | dbman.py
          | handler.py
          | logger.py
          | server.py
          | utilities.py
 
 Before go further remember to change Monitors name in properties file (line 1).
 You should also change port number (RestServer.java -> constructor -> line ~  39) if more than one
 Monitors gonna run on the same machine. Another thing is that Monitor will register in Catalog with
 host_ip on which will be run (e.g fatcat ip, so proper substitution should be done in Catalogs
 database in order to get globally accessible ip where forwarding to fatcat is set). 
 
 --- MAKEFILE ---
 Then you can use makefile:
 Building:
 target default - to build project
 Running:
 target run_java     - to run Monitor server - HTTP part
 target run_python   - to run Monitor server - UPD part
 target run_all      - to run both servers :]
 
 Or do it yourself as described below:
 --- COMPILATION --- 
 In project home directory
 $ javac -cp "json-simple-1.1.1.jar:sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar" monitor/Monitor.java monitor/RestServer.java monitor/DataBase.java
 
 --- RUN ---
 -- HTTP sever ---
 Make sure to kill previous running process, because it's block host port.
 In project home directory.
 $ java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar:json-simple-1.1.1.jar" monitor.Monitor
 -- UDP server ---
 Make sure you are using python version 3.4 or higher
 cd src
 python server.py
